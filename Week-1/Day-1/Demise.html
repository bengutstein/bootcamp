    <h1>Demise</h1>

    <p>Iron Man died at the end of Marvel's End Game. He sacrifices himself in order to save the universe. This is evidently the greatest deed that a superhero can accomplish for the people that they have sworn to protect. Iron Man will forever be etched in the history of superheroes because of his commitment to give in an effort to help others. The gesture at the end of this film is beautiful and will live in infamy.</p>
